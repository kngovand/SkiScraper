## ✨ About

Hi there! The goal of this project is to utilize a Python backend for web scraping/crawling to extract Winter Park mountain stats and display the data on a React website. Users will be able to see the weather, lifts/trails open, and how much it has snowed for
the current day. 


## 🤝 Considerations and goals

Input custom dates and compare historically  
API for data manipulation 
Text SMS for instant stats of the day    
Login for users?  
Deployment on Heroku  

## 🚀 Software Stack

Python backend webscraper: Selenium, Flask
Persistence: MySQL or AWS S3?  
React JS frontend using Bootstrap  
Twilio for texting API  
Postman for API testing
