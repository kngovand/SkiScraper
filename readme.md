## ✨ About

Hi there! The goal of this project is to utilize a Python back end for web scraping/crawling to extract Winter park mountain stats and display the data on a React website. Users will be able to see the weather, lifts/trails open, and how much it has snowed during a specific timeframe. 


## 🤝 Considerations and goals

Input custom dates and compare historically
API to request/post data
Text SMS for instant stats of the day... takes the hard work out for you!
Login for users?
Deployment on Heroku

## 🚀 Software Stack

Python backend with Beautiful Soup, Flask, Selenium?  
React JS frontend using Bootstrap  
Twilio for texting API  
Postman for API testing
